# Titanic
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset and applies machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
I used the dataset available on https://github.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/blob/master/titanic.csv
